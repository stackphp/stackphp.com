Specification for how community driven Stack proposals will be written and
managed.

 * Name: {{ page.title }}
 * Editor: Beau Simensen <[beau@dflydev.com](mailto:beau@dflydev.com)>


### Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).


### Goals

 * To define a workflow for community driven Stack proposals.


### Identification

 * Each proposal MUST have an identifier that MUST follow the format of
   `STACK-{NUMBER}`. The number SHOULD just the next available number but it MAY
   be a special number.
 * Each proposal MUST have a descriptive name that either names the subject of
   the proposal or otherwise succinctly defines the focus of the proposal.
