This document proposes conventions for authorization middlewares to follow in
order for applications and authentication middlewares to be able to interact
with each other.

### Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).


### Goals

 * To instruct authorization middlewares on how to determine if a request has
   been authenticated by a Stack authentication middleware.
 * To instruct authorization middlewares on how to respond in the event that
   authorization fails when a request is authenticated.
 * To instruct authorization middlewares on how to respond in the event that
   authorization fails when a request is not authenticated.


### Stack Authorization Middlewares

#### Token

Authorization should be based on the token stored in the
`stack.authentication.token` request attribute. This token should be a string
that can be used to gather additional information about the authenticated user
making the request.

#### Integration with Stack Authentication

If authentication is provided by way of `stack.authentication.token` but the
request is not authorized, a Stack authorization middleware MUST return a `403`
response.

If authentication is not provided by way of `stack.authentication.token`, a
Stack authorization middleware SHOULD return a `401` response with a
`WWW-Authenticate: Stack` header. This will give the appropriate Stack
authentication middlewares an opportunity to challenge as appropriate.


### Implementations

 * None
